Welcome to FewBodyECG.jl, a Julia package dedicated to the study and simulation of quantum mechanical few-body systems using explicitly correlated Gaussian methods. This package offers a powerful computational framework to model and analyze various quantum systems, from atoms and molecules to light nuclei and quantum dots.


## Features

- Variational Method Implementation: Utilizes the variational principle in quantum mechanics for approximating ground state energies and other properties.
Correlated Gaussian Basis Functions: Employs explicitly correlated Gaussian functions to accurately represent particle correlations.
- Wide Applicability: Suitable for a range of systems, including small atoms, molecules, and exotic quantum states.
- High Precision: Offers detailed and precise modeling capabilities.

## Install

To install FewBodyECG.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("FewBodyECG")
```
